## 3DSnooker

Hiyo! And welcome to this teeny tiny project of mine! It is currently splitted into two branches, master and pc (the one you are seeing now). As I intend to make it work on PC first then port to mobile, some stuffs might not work as expected. But not to worry! Just... Yeah.

Uses library:

- glm
- imgui
- glad
- tiny_obj_loader
- glfw for testing
